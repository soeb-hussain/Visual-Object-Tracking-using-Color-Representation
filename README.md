# Visual-Object-Tracking-using-Color-Representation
A Tracking algorithm based on Bayes classifier is proposed in the paper which uses Color representation as feature descriptor to predict target position with 5 degree of freedom

The covariance matrix helps tracker in adjusting with changing shape and size of target object. The algorithm can adjust its candidates to move towards target region. Moreover Filtering algorithm proposed in the report can facilitates the candidates to converge at the target region by accounting the local best candidate and global best candidate in the density function.


Below, I have demonstrated the functioning of the object detection model developed using the VOT dataset.
